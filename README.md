# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

### Notes

---

1. In Jsx you can only have one parent
2. You have to use className instead of class
3. Use htmlFor instead of for in label tag
4. if you wrap up formula in {} jsx will treat it to produce results. eg *{2 + 2} = 4* but 2 + 2 will be printed out because it is not in any curly braces.
5. I have also learn conditional statements and props
6. I have learnt from destructuring to styling and now using UseState and UseEffect hooks. Growing in the frontend
7. Learnt UseState and Portal
